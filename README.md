# Installation
## Measure Command
Check out our [latest release](https://github.com/tira-io/measure/releases/latest) to find a plethora of prebuilt binaries for various architectures (AMD64, ARM64) and operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS). Simply downloading what fits you should work since everything is compiled into a single file. 

## Measure API
### CMake (FetchContent)
```cmake
include(FetchContent)

# Use GIT_TAG to request the tag (or branch) you would like
FetchContent_Declare(measure GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/tira-io/measure.git GIT_TAG v0.0.1)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(measure)
target_link_libraries(<yourtarget> measure::measureapi)
```



# Usage
Generally, `measure` offers two ways of measuring programs: a [commandline interface](#command) and a [C-API](#api) that can be called from and integrated into other languages easily. Please also have a look at the [examples](./examples) to see how it can be used.

## Command
Type `measurecmd --help` to get a full description of the supported commandline arguments. Generally, you only need to call
```
measurecmd "<command>"
```
to measure everything, you may want to know about the shell command `<command>`.

## API
```c
#include <measure_api.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    const char* sources[] { "git", "system", "energy", "gpu" };
    char* outputJson;
    struct Measure* handle = start_measure(sources, true);
    /** Measure your code here **/

    stop_measure(handle, &outputJson);
    /** The collected data is serialized into outputJson **/
}
```
